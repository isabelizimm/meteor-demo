Meteor Demo
==============================

This repository has materials for a hands-on tutorial to demonstrate tools developed by Red Hat's Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence.

This tutorial highlights the capabilities of [Project Meteor](https://github.com/AICoE/meteor), which is a web application that converts users' GitHub repositories into [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) environments.


## About the Environment

The Operate First open source production OpenShift environment currently hosts Project Meteor and this demo. Operate First looks to open-source operations on community managed clusters. To learn more about Operate First, visit the [website](https://www.operate-first.cloud/) or GitHub [community](https://github.com/operate-first).
