# Building documentation

Jupyter Books natively render **.rst, .md, and .ipynb** files natively from a single GitHub repo in a beautiful way.

```{note}
You can also add in notes to enhance user experience.
```

## Headings for ease of navigation

For longer sections, you can use headings to split up your prose. A left- and right-side navigator help to organize the content for users.

```{sidebar} My sidebar
You can also add content to the sidebar.
```

## Output

Jupyter Books can be rendered as HTML or as a PDF. If you want to make the book in a certain style, you are able to [write custom CSS](https://jupyterbook.org/advanced/html.html#custom-assets).
